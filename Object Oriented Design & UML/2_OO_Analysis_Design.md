# OO Analysis and Design

Object-Oriented (OO) Analysis and Design is a structured method for analyzing and designing a system by applying object-oriented concepts. This design process involves investigating the objects that constitute the system. It begins with identifying these objects and then understanding the interactions between them.

## Steps in OO Analysis and Design

1. Identifying the objects in a system
2. Defining relationships between objects
3. Establishing the interface of each object
4. Making a design that can be converted to executables using OO languages

## Why We Use UML

To effectively document all this information, we need a standard method or tool — **Unified Modeling Language (UML)**.

- UML is the successor of object-oriented analysis and design methods.
- It is powerful enough to represent all OO concepts.
- UML diagrams visually represent object-oriented concepts.
- Understanding OO principles is essential before learning UML.

Let’s now explore **how we can model using UML**.
