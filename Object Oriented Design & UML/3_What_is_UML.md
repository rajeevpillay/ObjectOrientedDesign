# What is UML?

**UML** stands for **Unified Modeling Language** and is used to model the object-oriented analysis of a software system. UML provides a way of visualizing and documenting a system through a collection of diagrams, helping engineers, businesspeople, and architects understand both its structure and behavior.

## Benefits of Using UML

- Helps develop a quick understanding of a software system
- Breaks down complex systems into manageable, discrete pieces
- Graphical notations communicate design decisions clearly
- Independent of specific platforms, languages, or technologies
- Facilitates smoother handoffs between development teams

## Types of UML Diagrams

The current UML standard defines **14 different types** of diagrams. These are categorized into:

### Structural UML Diagrams

- Class Diagram
- Object Diagram
- Package Diagram
- Component Diagram
- Composite Structure Diagram
- Deployment Diagram
- Profile Diagram

### Behavioral UML Diagrams

- Use Case Diagram
- Activity Diagram
- Sequence Diagram
- State Diagram
- Communication Diagram
- Interaction Overview Diagram
- Timing Diagram

## Diagrams Covered in This Course

### 1. Use Case Diagram

Illustrates the functionality provided by the system through a set of user scenarios.

### 2. Class Diagram

Provides a conceptual model of the system by describing the structure and behavior of entities and their relationships.

### 3. Activity Diagram

Models the functional flow of control between two or more class objects.

### 4. Sequence Diagram

Describes interactions among classes in terms of exchanged messages over time.
